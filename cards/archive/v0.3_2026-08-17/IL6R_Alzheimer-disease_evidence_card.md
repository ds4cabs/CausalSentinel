# Target Evidence Card — IL6R × Alzheimer disease

**Verdict:** INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE — while genetic and GWAS associations link IL6R to Alzheimer's disease, no specific causal Mendelian randomization estimate is available for this disease.

> **Question actually answered:** the free-text disease was resolved to **MONDO_0004975 (Alzheimer disease)**. If that is not what you meant, every score below answers a different question.

## Evidence

| Evidence | Tool | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Causal effect (MR) — retrieved, not computed | `get_mr_result` | **not available** — no pQTL MR estimate for this protein in the resource (absence of an estimate is not evidence of no effect) |
| Target–disease association | `get_target_disease_evidence` | overall score=0.369 (literature=0.482, genetic_association=0.583) |
| Protein context | `get_uniprot_dossier` | P08887 — Interleukin-6 receptor subunit alpha; location: Cell membrane, Secreted, Secreted |
| Known modulators / druggability | `get_chembl_modulators` | **tool error** — ChEMBL HTTP 500 |
| Clinical variants | `get_clinvar_variants` | 366 ClinVar records; 1 pathogenic in a sample of 30 |
| Population constraint / LoF tolerance | `get_gnomad_constraint` | pLI=7.9e-11, LOEUF=1.03 → LoF-tolerant |
| Extra genetic evidence | `get_gwas_catalog` | 146 unique SNPs from 368/368 association rows |
| Pharmacogenomics | `get_pharmgkb_drug_gene` | 3 clinical annotations across 1 drugs (level 3: 2, level 4: 1) |

## Caveats declared by the tools

- **`get_target_disease_evidence`** — Free-text inputs were resolved to ontology terms: 'IL6R' -> ENSG00000160712 (IL6R); 'Alzheimer disease' -> MONDO_0004975 (Alzheimer disease). Scores below describe THAT term, not the free-text phrase.
- **`get_mr_result`** — IL6R HAS pQTL MR estimates in this resource, but NONE matched the requested disease 'Alzheimer disease'. The other outcomes are listed for context only — do not present them as evidence about 'Alzheimer disease'.
- **`get_clinvar_variants`** — Pathogenic count is over the 30 record(s) retrieved, NOT over all 366 ClinVar records for this gene; it is a sample, not a rate.

## Reasoning

Open Targets shows genetic and literature evidence supporting IL6R in Alzheimer's disease, complemented by numerous mapped GWAS associations. However, retrieved Mendelian randomization estimates do not include a matching causal effect estimate for Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the gene exhibits loss-of-function tolerance in gnomAD, indicating it is generally well-tolerated against loss-of-function variation. Pharmacogenomic annotations link IL6R with tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis, but direct target modulation data was unavailable due to a query error.
